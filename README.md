# FAA Weather Webcam for Airports (Raspberry Pi-Based)
This open-source project creates a Raspberry Pi-based third-party FAA Weather Webcam, designed to meet FAA Weather Camera Program Office (WCPO) standards. The system provides real-time weather and airport information for pilots, airport authorities, and users, enhancing preflight planning and situational awareness.

We are seeking contributors interested in helping build a compliant weather webcam system that can be used at airports and partnered with the FAA.

Key Features:
- FAA Compliance: Follows FAA WCPO guidelines, including image quality, siting, and performance standards.
- Image Requirements: Cameras capture images in 4:3 aspect ratio (640x480 or 1280x960) with a view of 70% sky and 30% terrain.
- Technical Specifications: Fixed-position cameras with static IP/URL, providing images in JPG format every 10 minutes.
- Real-Time Monitoring: Supports up to four cameras per site, providing reliable and frequent weather updates for aviation use.
- Help us enhance aviation safety by developing this FAA-compliant weather webcam network for airports!
